<h3>Temperature (F) vs Lattitude</h3>

                The plot shows that the temperature elevates closer to latitude 0 (equator), and decreases further north and south to the latitudes of 90 
                and -90. The southern hemisphere has higher temperatures than the northern hemisphere, but it is believed that this is because of the tilt 
                of the earth at the time of the data captured.
