<h3>Humidity (%) vs. Lattitude</h3>

                The % of humidity, is not distributed in the same way because we see that in most latitudes, there are cities with 100% humidity, this is probably due to the proximity of the city to the coast, 
                and it is not influenced by the latitude. The northern hemisphere seems to be more humid than the south.
