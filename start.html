                        <strong>Summary</strong><br>
                        <small>
                            In this exercise, we created a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the 
                            equator. To accomplish this, we used a simple Python library, the OpenWeatherMap API, and a little common sense to create a 
                            representative model of weather across world cities.
                            We built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
                            Temperature (F) vs. Latitude 
                            Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
                            Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
                            Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
                            The final notebook operated randomly selecting at least 500 unique (non-repeat) cities based on latitude and longitude. 
                            Then, performed a weather check on each of the cities using a series of successive API calls.   Includes a print log of each city as 
                            it's being processed with the city number and city name. Finally the CSV and the images generated are saved to local drive.
